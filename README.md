# Digital Systems Architecture Excercises

This repository contains a collection of 12 VHDL exercises developed for the Digital Systems Architecture university course. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of digital design, providing practical implementations of fundamental concepts in VHDL. All projects are developed for the VIVADO IDE.

Some exercises (names ending with _BOARD) are designed to work on the Digilent Artix 100T development board.

## Requirements
- VIVADO IDE
- Digilent Artix 100T development board (optional, for BOARD exercises)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/antoniocapone/digital_systems_architecture.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired exercise directory:
   ```bash
   cd digital_systems_architecture/Exercise01
   ```
3. Simulate the design using your preferred VHDL simulator.
